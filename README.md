# Neural-Net
## This is a simple binary classification neural network made with python(from scratch)

### add your test data with the sameple outputs in sampledata.py file, as to train the model 
### run the test.py file to fit the model, adjusting weights and biases of the neurons to fit your dataset by using backpropagation 
### you can also edit the number of neurons and layers in the Neural net, adjust the learning rate in the BinaryNeuralNet file
### then use NeuralNet(x) (where x is a set of inputs) to predict values
